<h1>2024 Jodo Seminar</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Welcome to registration for the 2024 Hoshu Dojo Jodo Camp!</h2>

  <p>This year will be Goto-Sensei's 11th trip to the Americas. Following the success of last year, we will be doing a gasshuku-style event - an all-inclusive camp where we train, stay, eat, and socialize together.</p>

  <p>This year's camp will be held again at Seattle University in Seattle, WA, from Friday July 5th through Monday July 8th, with training across two and a half days from Saturday through Monday. Both room and board will also be provided by Seattle U,  with the exception of the "formal" camp dinner on Saturday night held at Olmstead Restaurant. There will be several options of rooms available with differing price ranges. While staying at Seattle U is not required, it is highly encouraged. Food is available at the university even if you are not staying there - but will need to be pre-registered.</p>

  <p>Read on for more information about the camp, including the seminar schedule, accommodation, meals, and parking.</p>

  <p>We look forward to seeing you in July!</p>

  <h2>Parking</h2>

  <p>Parking is available through Seattle University. You can register now for a discounted price, or pay a higher fee if you
    decide when you arrive. The standard rate for parking is $18 per calendar day if you don't pre-pay. Either way, we do not need
    your car's registration information until you arrive.</p>

  <p>Street parking in the area is very limited. We strongly recommend parking with Seattle University if you are driving.</p>

  <p>We'll send more information closer to the date about parking with Seattle University - pre-paid or not.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Dietary and Special Accommodations</h2>

  <p>Please let us know in the "Dietary and Special Accommodations" section of the registration form if you require any
    special accommodation to fully participate in the seminar. Hoshu Dojo is responsible for notifying the University of any requests
    by seminar participants with disabilities for reasonable accommodation that would require modification of University
    facilities. Such notification must be made sufficiently in advance of the seminar for the University to consider the request,
    determine whether the requested modification constitutes a reasonable accommodation or creates an undue hardship, and enter a
    dialogue regarding the requested accommodation, if necessary. The University is not responsible for making the content of the
    seminar accessible to persons with disabilities, such as providing interpreters for the deaf or assistance to the
    vision-impaired.</p>

  <p>Please also note that Seattle University dining hall kitchens and the venue for Saturday night's dinner are not kosher or
    gluten free. Seattle University does have a station that avoids gluten but the kitchen still works with gluten in other areas.
    This may be okay for people avoiding gluten for dietary or philosophical reasons, but might cause problems for people with
    Celiac disease.</p>

  <p>Please let us know in the "Dietary and Special Accommodations" section of the registration form if any of this affects you so
    we can discuss arrangements.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Seattle University is a non-smoking campus</h2>

  <p>Smoking, vaping, and tobacco in any form are strictly prohibited everywhere on campus. Please find a public street off-campus
    to smoke, vape, chew tobacco, etc.</p>
