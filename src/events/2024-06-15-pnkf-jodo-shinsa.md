## PNKF Jodo Shinsa Requirements 

In General, eligibility for Jodo promotional examinations follows the AUSKF promotion requirements defined here: <a href="https://www.auskf.org/forms/promotion-exams">AUSKF Official Website - Promotion Exams</a>

* All persons participating in the Jodo promotional examination must have a current and valid national (AUSKF) and regional (e.g. PNKF) federation membership 
* If a person is a member of a regional federation other than the PNKF, their application must be approved by their federation president prior to the promotional examination 
* If a person is a member of an FIK affiliate outside the AUSKF, their application must be approved by the AUSKF vice-president prior to the promotional examination 
* First time or unranked applicants can test for a rank of 1-Kyu, but not beyond that rank, as defined by AUSKF Jodo promotional examinations boards 
* Examination results will be either Pass or Fail; no lower Kyu rank can be awarded if the candidate does not meet the passing criteria for the first rank of 1-Kyu 
* Age and time requirements for rank are as follows: 

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Requested Rank</th>
            <th>Minimum Age</th>
            <th>Months in Prior Rank</th>
            <th>Total Months of Practice</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1-Kyu</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1-Dan</td>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2-Dan</td>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3-Dan</td>
            <td>16</td>
            <td>24</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
 
In addition to the AUSKF promotion requirements, PNKF Jodo promotional examinations will comply with the following additional PNKF requirements as documented within PNKF Policies and Procedures:

* Because the scheduled date for promotional examinations varies from year-to-year, it is PNKF’s practice to allow applicants to test if the applicant would satisfy any age requirement within 21 days (3 weeks) after the examination date, e.g. if an applicant is 12 years old, but will be 13 years old within 21 days after the examination date, the applicant would be allowed to test for 1-Dan
* Skipping rank is not allowed
* Ranks awarded by non-FIK or non-AUSKF dojos will not be honored by the PNKF nor the AUSKF; those applicants requesting to test within the PNKF will follow initial rank examination rules as first-time applicants

### Ranks Requirements 

The rank requirements will be the requirements agreed upon by examiners for AUSKF Jodo promotional examination boards which have currently been in use for AUSKF Jodo promotional examinations since 2014. The requirements are as follows: 

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
