<h1>2024 March Vancouver Jodo Seminar, Grading, and Taikai</h1>

<section>
  <p>Hoshu Vancouver Dojo is thrilled to host an invigorating weekend event packed with Jodo activities. Included is a comprehensive Jodo
    seminar, an opportunity for grading, and a spirited taikai, promising a rich experience for budo enthusiasts of all levels.</p>

  <h2>Seitei Jodo Seminar</h2>
  <p>We will be holding a Seitei Jodo seminar led by highly experienced instructors, offering a comprehensive learning experience for
    practitioners of all levels; no prior experience is necessary to participate. Join us for a weekend of immersive training and guidance
    from seasoned experts in the art.</p>

  <h2>Jodo Grading</h2>
  <p>The event includes a Jodo grading component, allowing members to challenge ranks of 1-kyu and 1-dan. If you are eligible,
    speak with your sensei about coming to Vancouver to challenge the grading.</p>

  <h2>Jodo Taikai</h2>
  <p>Immerse yourself in the spirit of Jodo excellence by participating in our upcoming Taikai—a tournament where practitioners get to showcase
    their skills, and engage in friendly competition. A taikai is an excellent opportunity to elevate your understanding of the art, receive 
    constructive feedback from experienced instructors, and foster a sense of camaraderie that extends beyond the dojo. Don't miss out!</p>

  <h2>Guest Instructors</h2>

  <p><strong>Eric Tribe</strong>, 7-dan Renshi</p>
  <p><strong>Thomas Groendal</strong>, 6-dan Renshi</p>
