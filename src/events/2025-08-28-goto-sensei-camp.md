<h1>2025 Jodo Seminar</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Welcome to registration for the 2025 Hoshu Dojo Jodo Camp!</h2>

  <p>Repeating the success of previous years, we will be doing a gasshuku-style event - an all-inclusive camp where we train, stay, eat, and socialize together.</p>
  <p>This year's camp will be held again at Seattle University in Seattle, WA, from Thursday August 28th through Sunday August 31st, with training across two and a half days from Friday through Sunday. Room and board are provided by Seattle U - see the Accommodation and Meals section for more info. There is also a "formal" camp dinner on Saturday night held at a TBD location. While staying at Seattle U is not required, it is highly encouraged. Food is available at the university even if you are not staying there - but will need to be pre-registered.</p>
  <p>Read on for more information about the camp, including the seminar schedule, accommodation, meals, and parking.</p>
  <p>We look forward to seeing you in August!</p>

  <h3>About the meal plan</h3>

  <p>A meal plan is available to everyone attending the seminar, even if you're not staying at Seattle University. If you <em>are</em> staying at Seattle University, it's included in your accommodation package (required by Seattle University). Meals will be served at the Cherry Street Market at the Seattle University Student Center. The meal plan includes:</p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li>Friday breakfast, and lunch</li>
    <li>Saturday breakfast, and lunch</li>
    <li>Sunday breakfast</li>
  </ul>

  <p>More info on the meals will be provided closer to the date. Vegan options are also available - please let us know in the "Dietary and Special Accommodations" section of the registration form.</p>

  <p>There is also a group dinner planned for Saturday night at a nearby TBD location. Attendees will pay for their own meal and drinks directly to the restaurant on the night - more on this later.</p>

  <p>Please note: We are not requesting dinners at Seattle U this year, but we are also not formally planning a second group dinner. There are plenty of food options nearby, or people can bring their own food given the availability of fridges.</p>

  <h2>Parking</h2>

  <p>Parking is available through Seattle University. You can register now for a discounted price of $12.50 day, or pay a higher fee if you decide when you arrive. The standard parking rate is over $24 per calendar day if you aren’t pre-registered. Street parking in the area is very limited. We strongly recommend parking with Seattle University if you are driving.</p>

  <p>Instructions for using pre-paid parking will be emailed by Seattle U shortly before the event.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Dietary and Special Accommodations</h2>

  <p>Please let us know in the "Dietary and Special Accommodations" section of the registration form if you require any special accommodation to fully participate in the seminar. Hoshu Dojo is responsible for notifying the University of any requests by seminar participants with disabilities for reasonable accommodation that would require modification of University facilities. Such notification must be made sufficiently in advance of the seminar for the University to consider the request, determine whether the requested modification constitutes a reasonable accommodation or creates an undue hardship, and enter a dialogue regarding the requested accommodation, if necessary. The University is not responsible for making the content of the seminar accessible to persons with disabilities, such as providing interpreters for the deaf or assistance to the vision-impaired.</p>

  <p>Please also note that Seattle University dining hall kitchens and the venue for Saturday night's dinner are not kosher or gluten free. Seattle University does have a station that avoids gluten but the kitchen still works with gluten in other areas. This may be okay for people avoiding gluten for dietary or philosophical reasons, but might cause problems for people with Celiac disease.</p>

  <p>Please let us know in the "Dietary and Special Accommodations" section of the registration form if any of this affects you so we can discuss arrangements.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Seattle University is a non-smoking campus</h2>

  <p>Smoking, vaping, and tobacco in any form are strictly prohibited everywhere on campus. Please find a public street off-campus to smoke, vape, chew tobacco, etc.</p>
