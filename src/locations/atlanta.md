    bio: "Adam has been practicing martial arts since he was 6 years old and needed to develop self-confidence. After an impromptu first official lesson in Jodo during an Iaido seminar in 2017, Adam got hooked on the jo. Moving across the country strained his ability to practice, but Adam is now a student under Thomas Groendal and practices both Seitei and Shindo Muso Ryu Jodo. There is a stereotypical phrase in martial arts, &ldquo;Youâ€™ve done it once, now do it 10,000 more times&rdquo;. Adam believes that patience and diligence is the best path to improving. He may describe a technique, but showing and doing is the most important aspect of training. Adam has a well-developed palette of martial arts and has trained in several: Jodo (current), HEMA Longsword + Dussack (current), Kendo, Aikido, Iaido, and Tae Kwon Do."
