        bio: "Jess came to Jodo in early 2017, in pursuit of supplementing her Aikido which she started one year previous, both of which are her first forays into Japanese martial arts. She balanced both arts faithfully, even through a stint of teaching her own Aikido class, until mid-2019 when she opted to commit solely to Jodo. Along with partner and fellow student Jeff Kamo, Jess became a familiar face in the Hoshu Dojo network attending regular events south of the border, including training annually with Goto-sensei. Her other passions include: most varieties of gaming (board, video, table-top role-playing, to name a few), coding, and long, sunny walks with honorary dojo mascot and rescue dog, Oscar."

        },
        bio: "Oscar &ldquo;joined&rdquo; Jodo in 2022 a few months after his adoption by humans Jeff and Jess, and served as a stoic and watchful presense during class as a means to cope with some separation anxiety while he adjusted to his new life. He&apos;s even traveled for a few Hoshu Dojo events, and his good behaviour and silent charm have earned him the title of Dojo Mascot. These days, Oscar likely won&apos;t be found in the dojo as his anxiety has become more manageable, though he makes the occasional social appearance at certain gatherings."
