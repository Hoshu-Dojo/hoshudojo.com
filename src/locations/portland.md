He studied for six years in an American Taekwondo Federation fusion art that combined Taekwondo with Shaolin Kung Fu and Okinawan Karate. Moving to Portland, Oregon for college he met Michael Park at an on campus Aikido class and practiced for two years before moving to Meridian, Idaho after graduating. He lived there for two and a half years where he refined his Aikido skills with a fusion of Arnis and Filipino Kali, and studied Ip Man lineage Wing Chun. After moving back to Portland, he met up with his old friend Michael where he was introduced to Tom Groendal and to Goto Sensei at a seminar for Jodo and Daito Ryu Aikijujutsu. He has been studying under them for the past eight years."
