    bio: "Born in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, and raised in Perth, Western Australia, Marcus dabbled in Chinese martial arts from a young age before committing to studying ZNKR (Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei) Iaido and ZNKR Jodo in 2004. In 2007, Marcus moved to Seattle, Washington and continued to practice both arts. In 2012 Marcus met Thomas Groendal during the Jodo workshop at the AUSKF Iaido Nationals. He began training in ZNKR Jodo with Tom shortly after, and with Tom&apos;s guidance and encouragement, started the Seattle branch of Hoshu Dojo in late 2012. He began instruction in Shindo Muso Ryu Jojutsu under Goto-Sensei in 2013, and stopped practicing Iaido that same year to focus his efforts on Jodo and Shindo Muso Ryu."

The most convenient area for parking if nearby street parking is full can be found nearby in Cal Anderson Park, a less than five-minute walk away from the MAC.</p>
