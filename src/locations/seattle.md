        bio: "Born in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, and raised in Perth, Western Australia, Marcus dabbled in Chinese martial arts from a young age before committing to studying ZNKR Iaido and ZNKR Jodo under Ramon Lawrence and Russell Lawrence of Perth&apos;s Budokan Academy in 2004. In 2007, Marcus moved to Seattle, Washington for work, and continued to practice Iaido at Musokai Dojo. In 2012 Marcus met Thomas Groendal during the Jodo workshop at the AUSKF Iaido Nationals in Tacoma, Washington. He began training in ZNKR Jodo with Tom shortly after, and with Tom&apos;s guidance and encouragement, started the Seattle branch of Hoshu Dojo in late 2012. He began instruction in Shindo Muso Ryu Jojutsu under Kei Goto-Sensei in 2013. Marcus stopped practicing Iaido in early 2013 to focus his efforts on ZNKR Jodo and Shindo Muso Ryu."
